# dino Ubuntu Binaries
Binary packages (.deb) of [Dino](https://github.com/dino/dino) XMPP messager for Ubuntu.

You will find `.deb` binary builds of Dino in [releases](https://github.com/zocker-160/dino-ubuntu-binaries/releases).

## Supported versions

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

And probably also any distro which is based on those two.

## Why

Getting newer versions of Dino without compiling them manually is quite tricky. I was asked to share my private builds I use personally in a public repo so others could use it as well, so there you go.
